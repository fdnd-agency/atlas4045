# Handover | June 2025

## What is the current status of the project?
The first release candidate of the website was completed on May 4, 2025.
This means that the website is live and already in use.
The people who are currently in the system are the Jewish people who fell victim to the Holocaust with a personal poster in the Oosterpark neighborhood.
The main branch contains a live version for all the necessary information that we have now.
The dev branch contains a slightly expanded version intended for the information that is yet to come.

In the future, this website will house the stories of thousands of Jewish people from the Oosterparkbuurt who fell victim to the Holocaust,
and allow people to discover their stories through an intuitive interface.
Later, more Jewish Holocaust victims will be added to the system for whom no poster has been made and any stolpersteine ​​(monument stones).
The intention here is that this can be filtered separately.
The intention is therefore to redesign the website in order to be able to process more information in the design.
In the [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/design/bHh40tuxL1RjtEcWVJpZjF/Atlas-40-45?node-id=0-1&t=EaUPwnSQPBKCCWbI-1) a start has already been made by the CMD students.
So make sure this is looked at. No additional information has been given to us yet, but we do know that this is coming.
It is useful to discuss this with the client.
